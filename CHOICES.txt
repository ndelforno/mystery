CHOICES

First Choice: Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes..
Second Choice: Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
Third Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: Talk to them directly
Fifth Choice:Wait a minute. Helga should've known not to pick up the pipe. Everyone knows not to touch evidence at a crime scene. UNLESS... she was purposely trying to contaminate the pipe so that you wouldn't be able to lift her prints from it. Accuse her.
Sixth Choice: Approach Billy
Seventh Choice: Talk to Billy directly
Eighth Choice: As if! Billy's acting weird. He's clearly hiding something. Accuse Billy
Nineth Choice: Approach Danny
tenth Choice: You've seen enough. Danny's clearly guilty! Taking out the trash? Cleaning up the mess? Come on. Accuse Danny.
